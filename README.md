<h2>A Simple Calculator in Java using AWT!</h2>  

<p> This is a basic calculator using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). This calculator will perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, showcasing the power of Java's GUI capabilities.</p>
<br>

<h3>Let's get started with the step-by-step process:</h3>

<p>
**Step 1: Set Up Your Project**
Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE and make sure to have AWT imported.

**Step 2: Design the User Interface**
Using AWT components, design the calculator interface. You'll need buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and an equals (=) button.

**Step 3: Implement the ActionListener**
For each button, attach an ActionListener to handle user interactions. This listener will execute specific actions based on the button clicked, like appending digits, performing calculations, and displaying results.

**Step 4: Implement the Calculation Logic**
Inside the ActionListener, define the logic for calculations. Use a StringBuilder to store the input expression and operands. When the equals button is pressed, evaluate the expression and display the result.

**Step 5: Displaying the Result**
Create a text area or label to display the input expression and the calculated result.

**Step 6: Run Your Calculator**
Finally, set up the main method to create an instance of your calculator UI and display it to the user.
