ðŸ§® Building a Simple Calculator in Java using AWT! ðŸ“Š

Hey LinkedIn community! ðŸ‘‹ In this post, I'll guide you through creating a basic calculator using Java's Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT). This calculator will perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, showcasing the power of Java's GUI capabilities.

Let's get started with the step-by-step process:

**Step 1: Set Up Your Project**
Create a new Java project in your favorite IDE and make sure to have AWT imported.

**Step 2: Design the User Interface**
Using AWT components, design the calculator interface. You'll need buttons for digits (0-9), operators (+, -, *, /), and an equals (=) button.

**Step 3: Implement the ActionListener**
For each button, attach an ActionListener to handle user interactions. This listener will execute specific actions based on the button clicked, like appending digits, performing calculations, and displaying results.

**Step 4: Implement the Calculation Logic**
Inside the ActionListener, define the logic for calculations. Use a StringBuilder to store the input expression and operands. When the equals button is pressed, evaluate the expression and display the result.

**Step 5: Displaying the Result**
Create a text area or label to display the input expression and the calculated result.

**Step 6: Run Your Calculator**
Finally, set up the main method to create an instance of your calculator UI and display it to the user.


Building a simple calculator using AWT in Java is a fantastic way to learn about GUI programming and event handling. It's a stepping stone to more complex applications with graphical interfaces. Feel free to customize and expand upon this foundation as you continue to explore the world of Java and GUI development! ðŸš€ðŸŒŸ
